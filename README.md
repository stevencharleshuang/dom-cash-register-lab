# Cash Register Lab

## Your assignment is to build a basic electronic cash register. 

The user will be able to see a list of their purchases as well as a running total. 

**A few things to keep in mind while you work this out** 

 - How will you grab the user input? Remember your DOM manipulation skills.

 - How will you update the total? this would probably be a good place for a function.

 - How will you display the money? The amounts should be formatted with a dollar sign and two trailing zeroes.
