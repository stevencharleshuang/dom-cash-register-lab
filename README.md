# Cash-register-dom-lab

## Build a cash register app using vanilla javascript and DOM manipulation

WooHoo you made it through the week! You are all amazing, you should be very proud! Now it's time for your first solo project. You have until Sunday night to build out a basic cash register. You've all built out a memory game so you definitely hake the skills! So what exactly should this thing do? Glad you asked!

* Display a line for the user to input a value
* Have a submit button that a user can click to add the value to the total
* Grab the entered value when the submit button is clicked and display it correctly formatted like this: '$28.31'
* Have a place to display a running total of all the values the user has entered.
* Have a place that displays the values that the user has entered so far.

**Some points to keep in mind** 

* Commit early, Commit often, git is your friend!
* Pseudocode! Plan out your project before you write a line of code.
* Draw pictures! Having a visual representation of your project to work from is super helpful!
* Keep your functions short and conscise. A function should only do one thing!
